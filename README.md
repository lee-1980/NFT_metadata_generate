# Generative NFT Art

## Introduction

The `generative-art-nft` repository is a library for creating generative art. It was developed for the purpose of creating NFT avatar & collectible projects. This library was used to generate the artwork for the Scrappy Squirrels project. 

## Features

### Generate over a million distinct images with less than 60 traits
The library allows you to generate images every distinct possible combination of your traits. For context, if you had trait art for a project like [Bored Apes](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/#/home), the library could generate upwards of 1.2 billion distinct apes.

### Add rarity weights
The library also allows you to configure the image generation process in such a way that you have complete control over how rare each and every trait is.

### Generate compliant JSON metadata for your NFTs
There is now an added functionality to generate JSON metadata for your NFTs that are in compliance with OpenSea metadata requirements (and by extension, the general NFT metadata standard).

### Fuzzy friendly 
You can use this library even if you do not know how to program (in Python or otherwise). Do check out the [Tutorial](https://medium.com/scrappy-squirrels/tutorial-create-generative-nft-art-with-rarities-8ee6ce843133) for more details on how to use (non-technical) and extend (technical) the library.

## Installation

**Install required packages**

```pip install Pillow pandas progressbar2```

Upload your input assets in the `assets` folder, fill up the `config.py` file, and then run `python nft.py`.

In order to generate JSON metadata, define BASE_NAME, BASE_IMAGE_URL, and BASE_JSON in `metadata.py` and then run `python metadata.py`.

## Usage

I have authored a detailed tutorial explaining how to use this library. Check it out [here](https://medium.com/scrappy-squirrels/tutorial-create-generative-nft-art-with-rarities-8ee6ce843133)
